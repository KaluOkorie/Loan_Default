# Objectives 
1. What attributes should credit providers consider to best predict and
2. identify potential loan default?

# Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this study is titled South German Credit [Dataset 2020], sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/573/south+german+credit+update). It contains information on 1,000 loan applicants, each described by 21 features relevant to credit risk assessment. Notably, the dataset:
1. Has no missing values
2. Is provided in a .zip archive in .asc format
3. Contains German-language column names, which were translated to English for ease of analysis
  This dataset provides a solid foundation for building and evaluating machine learning models aimed at predicting loan default risk.
